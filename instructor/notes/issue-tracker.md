# Issue Tracker

We are working with the desktop support team to create an API that will be used as the backend for a new UI that allows *employees* to report problems with approved software to the desktop support folks.

## Notes From Meeting with The Desktop Support Team

> My Quesiton: Tell us how things work now.

- Right now, folks call in when they have an issue. The hold times are often long. Sometimes they *have* to call in, because they can't get online, or some other problem, but we want to make this more "self service".
- What we are *supposed to do* is just collect the information about the problem in order to "triage" the issue, and then have someone get back to them.
  - Sometimes, though, it's simple enough we can just help them out during that initial call. When that is the case we log it as "resolved".
- The triage process
  - During the initial call, when a user reports a problem, we try to prioritize the issue. This involves:
    - Is it stopping them from doing their jobs, or is it just a question or minor inconvenience?
    - If it is stopping them from doing their job, does the issue have a "customer impact"? These are typically higher priority.
    - Honestly, sometimes problems that are even low impact are prioritized higher, because the caller is a "VIP" - like the CEO or something.
- After the problem is triaged and prioritized:
  - The low priority issues are thrown into a bin, and whoever is working "Tier 1" support just take turns pulling from the bin and contacting the person with the issue.
  - For high priority issues (Priority 1 are customer impacting issues, Priority 2 are work stoppage issues), they go into other baskets. Tier 2 support people take these.
  - For those VIP issues, our manager sometimes handles those (gets face time with a VIP?) or if she is busy, they get handed to whoever is the most experienced tech that is around.
 
> My Question: How do these get resolved?

- Like I said, sometimes it is just "user error" - or they have a question. They are resolved on the first contact.
  - We usually try to contact them using email or chat, but sometimes a phone call, because the issue might be keeping them from email or chat.
- Sometimes the issue is bigger, and needs some follow-up or additional work.
  - Sometimes we need to send a tech, or have the employee bring their computer to us.
  - Sometimes we can do "remote support" by remotely taking over their machine.
  - In either case, if the issue is resolved, it is logged with some details about what we did (reinstall, permissions fix, etc.)
- Sometimes we can't fix the issue. Like if it is a problem or bug with the software itself.
  - With those, we usually forward it on to the Software Team. We aren't allowed to to contact the vendors ourselves, it has to go through the software team because of support contracts, etc.
  - We still like to report back to the employee, though.
    - Sometimes the sofware folks will tell us that the issue is known and planned to be fixed in a future update.
    - Every once in a while (rarely, tbh) the vendor gives us a fix or work around. We relay that to the employee.
    - At the very least, we let them know that it has been reported.
